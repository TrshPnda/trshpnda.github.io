My name is David and I like:

troubleshooting stuff

fixing stuff

breaking stuff

learning stuff

reading stuff (Graphic Novels, technical manuals)

lifting stuff... I really like lifting stuff. (315 squat, 200 bench, 315 deadlift @ 150 #lbs) 

and playing guitar sometimes. (Blues, Jazz, and Punk rock)

I like all kinds of music and I am a bit of a weeb. (FUTURE FUNK AND VTUBERS ARE THE FUTURE)

I believe we're heading towards a Shadowrun like dystopia... uhhh so learn to code.
