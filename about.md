My name is David and I like:

troubleshooting, fixing, breaking , learning, reading (Graphic Novels, technical manuals) and lifting stuff... I really like lifting stuff. (315 squat, 200 bench, 315 deadlift @ 150 #lbs) #err... pre-covid lol

and playing guitar sometimes. (Blues, Jazz, and Punk rock)
