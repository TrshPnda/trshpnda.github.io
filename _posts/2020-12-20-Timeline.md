Reflecting on my journey into cyber-security.

Pre 2020 - Fucking around with low level piracy and video game cheating.

January 2020 - Started the "Fast Track - Computer Security and Digital Forensics" certificate program at Ryerson University. (**Belgh >.> 8 hours of school everyday**) 

May 2020 - Graduated, started the OSCP course.

October 2020 - Won a local CTF and achieved the OSCP designation. (After failing it the first time cause no sleep and bad lol)

November 2020 - Got hired at Cycura and achieved Comptia Network Security Professional designation (Sec+, PenTest+, CySA+)

Starting AWAE in Jan 2021.

and a total of somewhere upwards of 130ish+ boxes pwned.

I am not going to lie - super burnt out and extremely glad the holidays are coming up. Gonna relax by watching vtubers, catching up with friends and working through grade 12 Advanced Functons (LOL!)

Heres to the new year, hoping it's more 2021 and less 2020.1 ;D
