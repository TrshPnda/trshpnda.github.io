Of doing this shit professionally haha, still it's been a great experience so far - plenty to learn and plenty to get good at. 

My scripting skills are coming along though. Check it.

Just a simple exploit script I wrote for an Offsec Proving Grounds Practice machine. Handles everything from account creation to the exploit itself as well as setting up the netcat listener to catch the reverse shell and prints a **sick** banner. ;D 

Starting AWAE in Jan. Can't wait.

Oh and Cyberpunk 2077's sound track is pretty dope.
