Passed the OSCP last weekend, placed 1st at my first CTF at Hackfest@BsidesToronto Beginners CTF 2020 and got a blog running.

Planning to use this space to post writeups, futurefunk, punk rock and cool art.

Screenshots or it didn't happen.

Shout out to kairaeda and Minchi for being great sports (if they ever find this blog that is lol)
