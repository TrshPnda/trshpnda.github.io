Starting a new position as a Cybersecurity Researcher in a offensive capability tomorrow. Pretty excited, kind of scared... I don't come from a usual CompSci background. 

I'm mostly self taught (apart from a security course I took at Ryerson this year)... and I just really love computers. Would have loved to see what academia has to offer (if they can look past the fact I don't have Grade 12 advanced functions) but for now I think I'm going to focus everything I have on getting good at this new role.

I got the offer two weeks ago but I didn't want to jinx the process LOL not that I have a colourful background myself but I did associate with some colourful people haha

The way I got the interview and ultimately the job was kind of crazy. If I hadn't networked as hard as I did within the Toronto community and if I didn't reach out to certain people with genuine questions and conversations... I wouldn't have landed this role.

So I suppose if you are out there struggling and don't have the "usual" background either... here's one of us who made it. Just keep hustling and you'll get somewhere.

Oh and I get to work with superkojiman... that's pretty fucking **sick**

Next thing to do on this blog? Do a write up on Dawn2 and Dawn3... I shouldn't keep whitecr0wz waiting =P
